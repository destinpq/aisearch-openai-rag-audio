deploy_production.sh â€” README

This repository includes a simple, safe deploy script: `deploy_production.sh`.

Purpose

- Build the frontend production bundle
- Copy frontend artifacts into `backend/static` (the backend serves those files)
- Optionally create a timestamped backup of the previous `backend/static`
- Optionally restart a named service (systemd or pm2)

Basic usage

From the repo root:

```bash
./deploy_production.sh
```

To skip backup:

```bash
./deploy_production.sh --no-backup
```

To restart a systemd service after deploy (requires sudo):

```bash
./deploy_production.sh --restart converse-backend
```

Notes

- The script will run `npm ci` in the `frontend` directory; ensure the machine has network access and Node installed.
- The script creates backups in `backups/static.YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` and keeps the last 5 backups by default.
- The script will not force-restart services by default; use the `--restart` flag to request a restart.

Example systemd service

Save the following as `/etc/systemd/system/converse-backend.service` and adapt paths:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Converse Backend
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/azureuser/aisearch-openai-rag-audio/backend
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/main.js
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After creating the unit file:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable converse-backend
sudo systemctl start converse-backend
```

Security

- The script uses `sudo systemctl restart` if `--restart` is provided; ensure the user has appropriate sudo privileges.

Contact

- If you want automatic zero-downtime deploys, consider using a more advanced deploy tool (pm2, capistrano, or Kubernetes) and a CI pipeline.
