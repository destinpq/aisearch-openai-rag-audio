We believe the next wave of media in India will be (a)\ncommunity\u2011anchored, (b) language\u2011native, and (c) AI\u2011accelerated. Our mission is to compress the distance\nbetween what people want to watch and what creators/teachers can produce\u2014without compromising\nsafety or quality.\nStrategic Objective (36 months): Achieve leadership in \u201ccommunity\u2011to\u2011content\u201d pipelines in India, reaching\n3\u20135 million community members, serving 50k paying creators/teachers, and capturing a defensible share of\nK\u201112 revision micro\u2011content through regional\u2011language depth.\n2) Market Analysis\n2.1 Macro Trends\n\u2022 Community\u2011based discovery: Telegram/Discord communities concentrate high intent and enable\nmicro\u2011payments, reducing dependence on opaque social algorithms.\n\u2022 AI\u2011assisted production: Script generation, voice cloning (with consent), and automated editing shrink\ntime\u2011to\u2011publish from days to hours.\n\u2022 Regional\u2011language demand: Parents, students, and teachers require accurate, local\u2011language content;\nvernacular growth outpaces English consumption.\n\u2022 UPI & sachet pricing: India\u2019s micro\u2011payment culture makes \u20b929\u2013\u20b999/month tiers viable at scale.\n2.2 Segments & Personas\nA.
