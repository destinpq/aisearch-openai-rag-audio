We are excited to offer our employees two comprehensive health\ninsurance plans through Northwind Health.\nNorthwind Health Plus\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive plan that provides comprehensive coverage for medical,\nvision, and dental services.

This\nplan also offers coverage for preventive care services, as well as prescription drug coverage. With\nNorthwind Standard, you can choose from a variety of in-network providers, including primary care\nphysicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.

The plans also cover preventive care services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and\nother cancer screenings.\nNorthwind Health Plus offers more comprehensive coverage than Northwind Standard.

Both plans offer coverage\nfor vision and dental services, as well as medical services.\nCost Comparison\nContoso Electronics deducts the employee's portion of the healthcare cost from each paycheck. This\nmeans that the cost of the health insurance will be spread out over the course of the year, rather\nthan being paid in one lump sum. The employee's portion of the cost will be calculated based on the\nselected health plan and the number of people covered by the insurance. The table below shows a\ncost comparison between the different health plans offered by Contoso Electronics:\nNext Steps\nWe hope that this information has been helpful in understanding the differences between Northwind\nHealth Plus and Northwind Standard. We are confident that you will find the right plan for you and\nyour family. Thank you for choosing Contoso Electronics!",

After that book, Dr Harish Chandra Verma\u2019s book on physics, CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS is\nanother such attempt, even though it is not directly in the dialogue form. I have thoroughly appreciated it, It\nis clear that Dr Verma has spent considerable time in formulating the structure of the book, besides its contents.\nI think he has been successful in this attempt. Dr Verma\u2019s book has been divided into two parts because of the\nsize of the total manuscript. There have been several books on this subject, each one having its own flavour.\nHowever, the present book is a totally different attempt to teach physics, and I am sure it will be extremely\nuseful to the undergraduate students. The exposition of each concept is extremely lucid. In carefully formatted\nchapters, besides problems and short questions, a number of objective questions have also been included. This\nbook can certainly be extremely useful not only as a textbook, but also for preparation of various competitive\nexaminations.\n\nThose who have followed Dr Verma\u2019s scientific work always enjoyed the outstanding contributions he has\nmade in various research areas. He was an outstanding student of Physics Department of IIT Kanpur during\nhis academic career. An extremely methodical, sincere person as a student, he has devoted himself to the task\nof educating young minds and inculcating scientific temper amongst them. The present venture in the form of\nthese two volumes is another attempt in that direction. | am sure that young minds who would like to learn\nphysics in an appropriate manner will find these volumes extremely useful.\n\nI must heartily congratulate Dr Harish Chandra Verma for the magnificent job he has done.\n\nY R Waghmare\nProfessor of Physics\nIIT Kanpur.",

Since then, a large number of teachers, students and physics lovers\nhave made valuable suggestions which I have incorporated in this work. It is not possible for me to acknowledge\nall of them individually. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to them. However, to Dr S B Mathur\nwho took great pains in going through the entire manuscript and made valuable comments, I am specially\nindebted. I am also beholden to my colleagues Dr A Yadav, Dr Deb Mukherjee, Mr M M R Akhtar,\nDr Arjun Prasad, Dr S K Sinha and others who gave me valuable advice and were good enough to find tine\nfor fruitful discussions. To Dr T K Dutta of B E College, Sibpur I am grateful for having taken time to go\nthrough portions of the book and making valuable comments.\n\nI thank my student Mr Shailendra Kumar who helped me in checking the answers. I am grateful to\nDr B C Rai, Mr Sunil Khijwania & Mr Tejaswi Khijwania for helping me in the preparation of rough sketches\nfor the book.\n\nFinally, I thank the members of my family for their support and encouragement.\n\nH C Verma\n\n(viii)\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most",

    "chunk": "\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most\neffectively. The book contains 47 chapters divided in two volumes. Though I strongly believe in the underlying\nunity of physics, a broad division may be made in the book as follows:\n\nChapters 1-14: Mechanics\n\n15-17: Waves including wave optics\n18-22: Optics\n\n23-28: Heat and thermodynamics\n\n29-40: Electric and magnetic phenomena\n41-47; Modern physics\n\nEach chapter contains a description of the physical principles related to that chapter. It is well supported\nby mathematical derivations of equations, descriptions of laboratory experiments, historical background, etc.\nThere are \"in-text\" solved examples. These examples explain the equation just derived or the concept just\ndiscussed. These will help you in fixing the ideas firmly in your mind. Your teachers may use these in-text\nexamples in the classroom to encourage students to participate in discussions.\n\nAfter the theory section, there is a section on Worked Out Examples. These numerical examples correspond\nto various thinking levels and often use several concepts introduced in that chapter or even in previous chapters.\nYou should read the statement of a problem and try to solve it yourself. In case of difficulty, look at the solution\ngiven in the book. Even if you solve the problem successfully, you should look into the solution to compare it\nwith your method of solution. You might have thought of a better method, but knowing more than one method\nis always beneficial.\n\nThen comes the part which tests your understanding as well as develops it further. Questions for Short\nAnswer generally touch very minute points of your understanding. It is not necessary that you answer these\nquestions in a single sitting. They have great potential to initiate very fruitful dicussions. So, freely discuss\nthese questions with your friends and see if they agree with your answer. Answers to these questions are not\ngiven for the simple reason that the answers could have cut down the span of such discussions and that would\nhave sharply reduced the utility of these questions\n\nThere are two sections on multiple-choice 4\nfour options following each of these questions. (y\n\nnely OBJECTIVE I and OBJECTIVE Il. There are\n\u2018 correct for OBJECTIVE I questions. Any number\n\nof options, zero to four, may be correct for 0!!! \u00bb Answers to all these questions are provided.\n\nFinally, a set of numerical problems are cc, Answers to these problems are also provided.\nThe problems are generally arranged accor|:: \u00a9 of the concepts developed in the chapter but\nthey are not grouped under section-heading: sat Sias your ideas beforehand by telling you that this\nproblem belongs to that section and hence use :e2 jx.: ticular equation. You should yourself look into the problem\n\nand decide which equations or which methods sould he used to solve it, Many of the problems use several\nconcepts developed in different sections of the chapter. Many of them even use the concepts from the previous\nchapters. Hence, you have to plan out the strategy after understanding the problem.\n\nRemember, no problem is difficult. Once you understand the theory, each problem will become easy. So, don\u2019t\njump to exercise problems before you have gone through the theory, the worked-out problems and the objectives.\nOnce you feel confident in theory, do the exercise problems. The exercise problems are so arranged that they\ngradually require more thinking.",

It unravels intricacies\nof the subject through a dialogue between Teacher and Student. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. For me this\nseemed to be one of the few books which teach a difficult subject through inquisition, and using programmed\nconcept for learning. After that book, Dr Harish Chandra Verma\u2019s book on physics, CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS is\nanother such attempt, even though it is not directly in the dialogue form. I have thoroughly appreciated it, It\nis clear that Dr Verma has spent considerable time in formulating the structure of the book, besides its contents.\nI think he has been successful in this attempt. Dr Verma\u2019s book has been divided into two parts because of the\nsize of the total manuscript. There have been several books on this subject, each one having its own flavour.\nHowever, the present book is a totally different attempt to teach physics, and I am sure it will be extremely\nuseful to the undergraduate students. The exposition of each concept is extremely lucid. In carefully formatted\nchapters, besides problems and short questions, a number of objective questions have also been included. This\nbook can certainly be extremely useful not only as a textbook, but also for preparation of various competitive\nexaminations.\n\nThose who have followed Dr Verma\u2019s scientific work always enjoyed the outstanding contributions he has\nmade in various research areas. He was an outstanding student of Physics Department of IIT Kanpur during\nhis academic career. An extremely methodical, sincere person as a student, he has devoted himself to the task\nof educating young minds and inculcating scientific temper amongst them. The present venture in the form of\nthese two volumes is another attempt in that direction. | am sure that young minds who would like to learn\nphysics in an appropriate manner will find these volumes extremely useful.\n\nI must heartily congratulate Dr Harish Chandra Verma for the magnificent job he has done.\n\nY R Waghmare\nProfessor of Physics\nIIT Kanpur.",

However, to Dr S B Mathur\nwho took great pains in going through the entire manuscript and made valuable comments, I am specially\nindebted. I am also beholden to my colleagues Dr A Yadav, Dr Deb Mukherjee, Mr M M R Akhtar,\nDr Arjun Prasad, Dr S K Sinha and others who gave me valuable advice and were good enough to find tine\nfor fruitful discussions. To Dr T K Dutta of B E College, Sibpur I am grateful for having taken time to go\nthrough portions of the book and making valuable comments.\n\nI thank my student Mr Shailendra Kumar who helped me in checking the answers.

    "chunk": "\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most\neffectively. The book contains 47 chapters divided in two volumes. Though I strongly believe in the underlying\nunity of physics, a broad division may be made in the book as follows:\n\nChapters 1-14: Mechanics\n\n15-17: Waves including wave optics\n18-22: Optics\n\n23-28: Heat and thermodynamics\n\n29-40: Electric and magnetic phenomena\n41-47; Modern physics\n\nEach chapter contains a description of the physical principles related to that chapter. It is well supported\nby mathematical derivations of equations, descriptions of laboratory experiments, historical background, etc.\nThere are \"in-text\" solved examples. These examples explain the equation just derived or the concept just\ndiscussed. These will help you in fixing the ideas firmly in your mind. Your teachers may use these in-text\nexamples in the classroom to encourage students to participate in discussions.\n\nAfter the theory section, there is a section on Worked Out Examples. These numerical examples correspond\nto various thinking levels and often use several concepts introduced in that chapter or even in previous chapters.\nYou should read the statement of a problem and try to solve it yourself. In case of difficulty, look at the solution\ngiven in the book. Even if you solve the problem successfully, you should look into the solution to compare it\nwith your method of solution. You might have thought of a better method, but knowing more than one method\nis always beneficial.\n\nThen comes the part which tests your understanding as well as develops it further. Questions for Short\nAnswer generally touch very minute points of your understanding. It is not necessary that you answer these\nquestions in a single sitting. They have great potential to initiate very fruitful dicussions. So, freely discuss\nthese questions with your friends and see if they agree with your answer. Answers to these questions are not\ngiven for the simple reason that the answers could have cut down the span of such discussions and that would\nhave sharply reduced the utility of these questions\n\nThere are two sections on multiple-choice 4\nfour options following each of these questions. (y\n\nnely OBJECTIVE I and OBJECTIVE Il. There are\n\u2018 correct for OBJECTIVE I questions. Any number\n\nof options, zero to four, may be correct for 0!!! \u00bb Answers to all these questions are provided.\n\nFinally, a set of numerical problems are cc, Answers to these problems are also provided.\nThe problems are generally arranged accor|:: \u00a9 of the concepts developed in the chapter but\nthey are not grouped under section-heading: sat Sias your ideas beforehand by telling you that this\nproblem belongs to that section and hence use :e2 jx.: ticular equation. You should yourself look into the problem\n\nand decide which equations or which methods sould he used to solve it, Many of the problems use several\nconcepts developed in different sections of the chapter. Many of them even use the concepts from the previous\nchapters. Hence, you have to plan out the strategy after understanding the problem.\n\nRemember, no problem is difficult. Once you understand the theory, each problem will become easy. So, don\u2019t\njump to exercise problems before you have gone through the theory, the worked-out problems and the objectives.\nOnce you feel confident in theory, do the exercise problems. The exercise problems are so arranged that they\ngradually require more thinking.",

Many of\nthem are rare and of no concern to us in the present\ncourse. The three most common elementary particles\nare electrons, protons and neutrons having masses\nm, = 9110940 x 10\" kg, m, = 167262 x 107\u201d kg and\nm, = 167493 x 10 \u201ckg. Because of their mass these\nparticles attract each other by gravitational forces.\nThus, an electron attracts another electron, placed\n1 cm away, with a gravitational force\n\nF Gm,m,\n\nr\n_ (67x 10\n\n-u 2\n\nNm \u2018kg *)x (91x10 kg)\n(10\u00b0 m)?\n\n-67\n\n=5:5x10 N.\n\nHowever, an electron is found to repel another\nelectron at lem with a force of 23x 10~\u201cN. This\nextra force is called the electric force. The electric force\nis very large as compared to the gravitational force\nThe electrons must have some additional property,\napart from their mass, which is responsible for the\nelectric force. We call this property charge. Just as\nmasses are responsible for the gravitational force,\ncharges are responsible for the electric force. Two\nprotons placed at a distance of 1cm also repel each\nother with a force of 2\u00b03x 10-\u201cN. Thus, protons also\nhave charge. Two neutrons placed at a distance of 1 cm\nattract each other with a force of 1:9x 10~\u201d N which\n\n. G",

G\nis equal to pace Thus, neutrons exert only\n\ngravitational force on each other and experience no\nelectric force. The neutrons have mass but no charge.\nTwo Kinds of Charges\n\n+ As mentioned above, the electric force between two\nelectrons is the same as the electric force between two\n\nprotons placed at the same separation. We may guess\nthat the amount of charge on an electron is the same\nas that on a proton. However, if a proton and an\nelectron are placed 1 cm apart, they attract each other\nwith a force of 23x10 \u201c'N. Certainly this force is\nelectric, but it is attractive and not repulsive. The\ncharge on an electron repels the charge on another\nelectron but attracts the charge on a proton. Thus,\nalthough the charge on an electron and that on a\nproton have the same strength, they are of two\ndifferent nature. Also, if we pack a proton and an\nelectron together in a small volume, the combination\ndoes not attract or repel another electron or proton\nplaced at a distance. The net charge on the\nproton-electron system seems to be zero. It is,\ntherefore, convenient to define one charge as positive\nand the other as negative. We arbitrarily call the\ncharge on a proton as positive and that on an electron\nas negative. This assignment of positive and negative\nsigns to the proton charge and the electron charge is\npurely a convention. It does not mean that the charge\non an electron is \u201cless\u201d than the charge on a proton.\n\nUnit of Charge\n\nThe above discussion suggests that charge is a\nbasic property associated with the elementary particles\nand its definition is as difficult as the definition of\nmass or time or length. We can measure the charge\non a system by comparing it with the charge on a\nstandard body but we do not know what exactly it is\nthat we intend to measure. The SI unit of charge is\ncoulomb abbreviated as C. 1 coulomb is the charge\nflowing through a wire in 1s if the electric current in\nit is 1 A. The charge on a proton is\n\ne= 160218 x 10\u00b0\" C,\nThe charge on an electron is the negative of this value.\n\nCharge is Quantized\n\nIf protons and electrons are the only charge\ncarriers in the universe, all observable charges must\n\n",

If an object contains n,\nprotons and n, electrons, the net charge on the object is\nny(e) + n(- e) = (ny = n,)e.\n\nIndeed, there are elementary particles other than\nprotons and electrons, which carry charge. However,\nthey all carry charges which are integral multiples of\ne. Thus, the charge on any object is always an integral\nmultiple of e and can be changed only in steps of e,\nie. charge is quantized. ,\n\nThe step size e is usually so small that we can\neasily neglect the quantization.

Long\nago, around 600 BC, the Greeks knew that when amber\nis rubbed with wool, it acquires the property of\nattracting light objects such as small pieces of paper.\nThis is because amber becomes electrically charged. If\nwe pass a comb through dry hair, the comb becomes\nelectrically charged and can attract small pieces of\npaper. An automobile becomes charged when it travels\nthrough the air.

A gramophone\nrecord becomes charged when cleaned with a dry cloth.\n\nThe explanation of appearance of electric charge\non rubbing is simple. All material bodies contain large\nnumber of electrons and equal number of protons in\ntheir normal state. When rubbed against each other,\nsome electrons from one body may pass on to the other\nbody, The body that receives the extra electrons,\nbecomes negatively charged. The body that donates the\nelectrons, becomes positively charged because it has\nmore protons than electrons. Thus, when a glass rod\nis rubbed with a silk cloth, electrons are transferred\nfrom the glass rod to the silk cloth. The glass rod\n\nbecomes positively charged and the silk cloth becomes\nnegatively charged.\n\nIf we take a positively charged glass rod near small\npieces of paper, the rod attracts the pieces. Why does\nthe rod attract paper pieces which are uncharged ? This\nis because the positively charged rod attracts the\nelectrons of a paper piece towards itself. Some of the\nelectrons accumulate at that edge of the paper piece\nwhich is closer to the rod, At the farther end of the piece\nthere is a deficiency of electrons and hence positive\ncharge appears there. Such a redistribution of charge in\na material, due to the presence of a nearby charged body,\nis called induction. The rod exerts larger attraction on\nthe negative charges of the paper piece as compared to\nthe repulsion on the positive charges. This is because the\nnegative charges are closer to the rod. Hence, there is a\nnet attraction between the rod and the paper piece.\n\n29.2 COULOMB\u2019S LAW\n\nThe experiments of Coulomb and others established\nthat the force exerted by a charged particle on the other\nis given by\n\nrah,\nr\n\nve (29.1)\n\nwhere g, and q, are the charges on the particles, r is the\nseparation between them and k is a constant. The force\nis attractive if the charges are of opposite signs and is\nrepulsive if they are of the same sign. We can write\nCoulomb's law as 5\nRqigo?\n\nre\nwhere 7 is the position vector of the force-experiencing\nparticle with respect to the force-exerting particle.

A particle creates\na gravitational field around it and this field exerts\nforce on another particle placed in it. The electric force\nbetween two charged particles is also seen as a two-\nstep process. A charge produces something called an\nelectric field in the space around it and this electric\nfield exerts a force on any charge (except the source\ncharge itself) placed in it. The electric field has its own\nexistence and is present even if there is no additional\ncharge to experience the force. The field takes finite\ntime to propagate. Thus, if a charge is displaced from\nits position, the field at a distance r will change after\na time t=r/c, where c is the speed of light. We define\nthe intensity of electric field at a point as follows:\n\nBring a charge g at the given point without\ndisturbing any other charge that has produced the\nfield. If the charge g experiences an electric force F,\nwe define the intensity of electric field at the given\n",

In solids and liquids, the\ninteraction is comparatively stronger. It turns out that\nthe materials may be broadly divided into three\ncategories according to their behaviour when they are\nplaced in an electric field.\n\nIn some materials, the outer electrons of each atom\nor molecule are only weakly bound to it. These\nelectrons are almost free to move throughout the body\nof the material and are called free electrons. They are\nalso known as conduction electrons. When such a\nmaterial is placed in an electric field, the free electrons\n\nmove in a direction opposite to the field. Such\nmaterials are called conductors.\n\nAnother class of materials is called insulators\nin which all the electrons are tightly bound to\ntheir respective atoms or molecules.

When such a material is\nplaced in an electric field, the electrons may slightly\nshift opposite to the field but they can\u2019t leave their\nparent atoms or molecules and hence can't move\nthrough long distances. Such materials are also called\ndielectrics.\n\nIn semiconductors, the behaviour is like an insulator\nat the temperature 0 K. But at higher temperatures, a\nsmall number of electrons are able to free themselves\nand they respond to the applied electric field. As the\nnumber of free electrons in a semiconductor is much\nsmaller than that in a conductor, its behaviour is in\nbetween a conductor and an insulator and hence, the\nname semiconductor. A freed electron in a semiconductor\nleaves a vacancy in its normal bound position. These\nvacancies also help in conduction.\n\nWe shall learn more about conductivity in later\nchapters. At the moment we accept the simple\napproximate model described above. The conductors\nhave large number of free electrons everywhere in the\nmaterial. whereas the insulators have none. The\ndiscussion of semiconductors is deferred to a separate\nchapter.\n\nRoughly speaking, the metals are conductors and\nthe nonmetals are insulators.

This field exerts\nforce on the free electrons from right to left. The\nelectrons move towards left, the number of electrons\non the left face increases and the number on the right\nface decreases. The left face becomes negatively\ncharged and the right face becomes positively charged.\nThese extra charges produce an extra electric field\nE\u2019 inside the plate from right to left.

The electrons\ncontinue to drift and the internal field E\u2019 becomes\nstronger and stronger. A situation comes when the\nfield E\u2019 due to the redistribution of free electrons\n\nbecomes equal in magnitude to E. The net electric field\ninside the plate is then zero. The free electrons there\ndo not experience any net force and the process of\nfurther drifting stops. Thus, a steady state is reached\nin which some positive and negative charges appear\nat the surface of the plate and there is no electric field\ninside the plate.\n\nWhenever a conductor is placed in an electric field\nsome of the free electrons redistribute themselves on\nthe surface of the conductor. The redistribution takes\nplace in such a way that the electric field is zero at\nall the points inside the conductor. The redistribution\ntakes a time which is, in general, less than a\nmillisecond.

It unravels intricacies\nof the subject through a dialogue between Teacher and Student. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. For me this\nseemed to be one of the few books which teach a difficult subject through inquisition, and using programmed\nconcept for learning. After that book, Dr Harish Chandra Verma\u2019s book on physics, CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS is\nanother such attempt, even though it is not directly in the dialogue form. I have thoroughly appreciated it, It\nis clear that Dr Verma has spent considerable time in formulating the structure of the book, besides its contents.\nI think he has been successful in this attempt. Dr Verma\u2019s book has been divided into two parts because of the\nsize of the total manuscript. There have been several books on this subject, each one having its own flavour.\nHowever, the present book is a totally different attempt to teach physics, and I am sure it will be extremely\nuseful to the undergraduate students. The exposition of each concept is extremely lucid. In carefully formatted\nchapters, besides problems and short questions, a number of objective questions have also been included. This\nbook can certainly be extremely useful not only as a textbook, but also for preparation of various competitive\nexaminations.\n\nThose who have followed Dr Verma\u2019s scientific work always enjoyed the outstanding contributions he has\nmade in various research areas. He was an outstanding student of Physics Department of IIT Kanpur during\nhis academic career. An extremely methodical, sincere person as a student, he has devoted himself to the task\nof educating young minds and inculcating scientific temper amongst them. The present venture in the form of\nthese two volumes is another attempt in that direction. | am sure that young minds who would like to learn\nphysics in an appropriate manner will find these volumes extremely useful.\n\nI must heartily congratulate Dr Harish Chandra Verma for the magnificent job he has done.\n\nY R Waghmare\nProfessor of Physics\nIIT Kanpur.",

Since then, a large number of teachers, students and physics lovers\nhave made valuable suggestions which I have incorporated in this work. It is not possible for me to acknowledge\nall of them individually. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to them. However, to Dr S B Mathur\nwho took great pains in going through the entire manuscript and made valuable comments, I am specially\nindebted. I am also beholden to my colleagues Dr A Yadav, Dr Deb Mukherjee, Mr M M R Akhtar,\nDr Arjun Prasad, Dr S K Sinha and others who gave me valuable advice and were good enough to find tine\nfor fruitful discussions. To Dr T K Dutta of B E College, Sibpur I am grateful for having taken time to go\nthrough portions of the book and making valuable comments.\n\nI thank my student Mr Shailendra Kumar who helped me in checking the answers. I am grateful to\nDr B C Rai, Mr Sunil Khijwania & Mr Tejaswi Khijwania for helping me in the preparation of rough sketches\nfor the book.\n\nFinally, I thank the members of my family for their support and encouragement.\n\nH C Verma\n\n(viii)\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most",

    "chunk": "\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most\neffectively. The book contains 47 chapters divided in two volumes. Though I strongly believe in the underlying\nunity of physics, a broad division may be made in the book as follows:\n\nChapters 1-14: Mechanics\n\n15-17: Waves including wave optics\n18-22: Optics\n\n23-28: Heat and thermodynamics\n\n29-40: Electric and magnetic phenomena\n41-47; Modern physics\n\nEach chapter contains a description of the physical principles related to that chapter. It is well supported\nby mathematical derivations of equations, descriptions of laboratory experiments, historical background, etc.\nThere are \"in-text\" solved examples. These examples explain the equation just derived or the concept just\ndiscussed. These will help you in fixing the ideas firmly in your mind. Your teachers may use these in-text\nexamples in the classroom to encourage students to participate in discussions.\n\nAfter the theory section, there is a section on Worked Out Examples. These numerical examples correspond\nto various thinking levels and often use several concepts introduced in that chapter or even in previous chapters.\nYou should read the statement of a problem and try to solve it yourself. In case of difficulty, look at the solution\ngiven in the book. Even if you solve the problem successfully, you should look into the solution to compare it\nwith your method of solution. You might have thought of a better method, but knowing more than one method\nis always beneficial.\n\nThen comes the part which tests your understanding as well as develops it further. Questions for Short\nAnswer generally touch very minute points of your understanding. It is not necessary that you answer these\nquestions in a single sitting. They have great potential to initiate very fruitful dicussions. So, freely discuss\nthese questions with your friends and see if they agree with your answer. Answers to these questions are not\ngiven for the simple reason that the answers could have cut down the span of such discussions and that would\nhave sharply reduced the utility of these questions\n\nThere are two sections on multiple-choice 4\nfour options following each of these questions. (y\n\nnely OBJECTIVE I and OBJECTIVE Il. There are\n\u2018 correct for OBJECTIVE I questions. Any number\n\nof options, zero to four, may be correct for 0!!! \u00bb Answers to all these questions are provided.\n\nFinally, a set of numerical problems are cc, Answers to these problems are also provided.\nThe problems are generally arranged accor|:: \u00a9 of the concepts developed in the chapter but\nthey are not grouped under section-heading: sat Sias your ideas beforehand by telling you that this\nproblem belongs to that section and hence use :e2 jx.: ticular equation. You should yourself look into the problem\n\nand decide which equations or which methods sould he used to solve it, Many of the problems use several\nconcepts developed in different sections of the chapter. Many of them even use the concepts from the previous\nchapters. Hence, you have to plan out the strategy after understanding the problem.\n\nRemember, no problem is difficult. Once you understand the theory, each problem will become easy. So, don\u2019t\njump to exercise problems before you have gone through the theory, the worked-out problems and the objectives.\nOnce you feel confident in theory, do the exercise problems. The exercise problems are so arranged that they\ngradually require more thinking.",

Many of\nthem are rare and of no concern to us in the present\ncourse. The three most common elementary particles\nare electrons, protons and neutrons having masses\nm, = 9110940 x 10\" kg, m, = 167262 x 107\u201d kg and\nm, = 167493 x 10 \u201ckg. Because of their mass these\nparticles attract each other by gravitational forces.\nThus, an electron attracts another electron, placed\n1 cm away, with a gravitational force\n\nF Gm,m,\n\nr\n_ (67x 10\n\n-u 2\n\nNm \u2018kg *)x (91x10 kg)\n(10\u00b0 m)?\n\n-67\n\n=5:5x10 N.\n\nHowever, an electron is found to repel another\nelectron at lem with a force of 23x 10~\u201cN. This\nextra force is called the electric force. The electric force\nis very large as compared to the gravitational force\nThe electrons must have some additional property,\napart from their mass, which is responsible for the\nelectric force. We call this property charge. Just as\nmasses are responsible for the gravitational force,\ncharges are responsible for the electric force. Two\nprotons placed at a distance of 1cm also repel each\nother with a force of 2\u00b03x 10-\u201cN. Thus, protons also\nhave charge. Two neutrons placed at a distance of 1 cm\nattract each other with a force of 1:9x 10~\u201d N which\n\n. G",

G\nis equal to pace Thus, neutrons exert only\n\ngravitational force on each other and experience no\nelectric force. The neutrons have mass but no charge.\nTwo Kinds of Charges\n\n+ As mentioned above, the electric force between two\nelectrons is the same as the electric force between two\n\nprotons placed at the same separation. We may guess\nthat the amount of charge on an electron is the same\nas that on a proton. However, if a proton and an\nelectron are placed 1 cm apart, they attract each other\nwith a force of 23x10 \u201c'N. Certainly this force is\nelectric, but it is attractive and not repulsive. The\ncharge on an electron repels the charge on another\nelectron but attracts the charge on a proton. Thus,\nalthough the charge on an electron and that on a\nproton have the same strength, they are of two\ndifferent nature. Also, if we pack a proton and an\nelectron together in a small volume, the combination\ndoes not attract or repel another electron or proton\nplaced at a distance. The net charge on the\nproton-electron system seems to be zero. It is,\ntherefore, convenient to define one charge as positive\nand the other as negative. We arbitrarily call the\ncharge on a proton as positive and that on an electron\nas negative. This assignment of positive and negative\nsigns to the proton charge and the electron charge is\npurely a convention. It does not mean that the charge\non an electron is \u201cless\u201d than the charge on a proton.\n\nUnit of Charge\n\nThe above discussion suggests that charge is a\nbasic property associated with the elementary particles\nand its definition is as difficult as the definition of\nmass or time or length. We can measure the charge\non a system by comparing it with the charge on a\nstandard body but we do not know what exactly it is\nthat we intend to measure. The SI unit of charge is\ncoulomb abbreviated as C. 1 coulomb is the charge\nflowing through a wire in 1s if the electric current in\nit is 1 A. The charge on a proton is\n\ne= 160218 x 10\u00b0\" C,\nThe charge on an electron is the negative of this value.\n\nCharge is Quantized\n\nIf protons and electrons are the only charge\ncarriers in the universe, all observable charges must\n\n",

If an object contains n,\nprotons and n, electrons, the net charge on the object is\nny(e) + n(- e) = (ny = n,)e.\n\nIndeed, there are elementary particles other than\nprotons and electrons, which carry charge. However,\nthey all carry charges which are integral multiples of\ne. Thus, the charge on any object is always an integral\nmultiple of e and can be changed only in steps of e,\nie. charge is quantized. ,\n\nThe step size e is usually so small that we can\neasily neglect the quantization.

Long\nago, around 600 BC, the Greeks knew that when amber\nis rubbed with wool, it acquires the property of\nattracting light objects such as small pieces of paper.\nThis is because amber becomes electrically charged. If\nwe pass a comb through dry hair, the comb becomes\nelectrically charged and can attract small pieces of\npaper. An automobile becomes charged when it travels\nthrough the air.

A gramophone\nrecord becomes charged when cleaned with a dry cloth.\n\nThe explanation of appearance of electric charge\non rubbing is simple. All material bodies contain large\nnumber of electrons and equal number of protons in\ntheir normal state. When rubbed against each other,\nsome electrons from one body may pass on to the other\nbody, The body that receives the extra electrons,\nbecomes negatively charged. The body that donates the\nelectrons, becomes positively charged because it has\nmore protons than electrons. Thus, when a glass rod\nis rubbed with a silk cloth, electrons are transferred\nfrom the glass rod to the silk cloth. The glass rod\n\nbecomes positively charged and the silk cloth becomes\nnegatively charged.\n\nIf we take a positively charged glass rod near small\npieces of paper, the rod attracts the pieces. Why does\nthe rod attract paper pieces which are uncharged ? This\nis because the positively charged rod attracts the\nelectrons of a paper piece towards itself. Some of the\nelectrons accumulate at that edge of the paper piece\nwhich is closer to the rod, At the farther end of the piece\nthere is a deficiency of electrons and hence positive\ncharge appears there. Such a redistribution of charge in\na material, due to the presence of a nearby charged body,\nis called induction. The rod exerts larger attraction on\nthe negative charges of the paper piece as compared to\nthe repulsion on the positive charges. This is because the\nnegative charges are closer to the rod. Hence, there is a\nnet attraction between the rod and the paper piece.\n\n29.2 COULOMB\u2019S LAW\n\nThe experiments of Coulomb and others established\nthat the force exerted by a charged particle on the other\nis given by\n\nrah,\nr\n\nve (29.1)\n\nwhere g, and q, are the charges on the particles, r is the\nseparation between them and k is a constant. The force\nis attractive if the charges are of opposite signs and is\nrepulsive if they are of the same sign. We can write\nCoulomb's law as 5\nRqigo?\n\nre\nwhere 7 is the position vector of the force-experiencing\nparticle with respect to the force-exerting particle.

A particle creates\na gravitational field around it and this field exerts\nforce on another particle placed in it. The electric force\nbetween two charged particles is also seen as a two-\nstep process. A charge produces something called an\nelectric field in the space around it and this electric\nfield exerts a force on any charge (except the source\ncharge itself) placed in it. The electric field has its own\nexistence and is present even if there is no additional\ncharge to experience the force. The field takes finite\ntime to propagate. Thus, if a charge is displaced from\nits position, the field at a distance r will change after\na time t=r/c, where c is the speed of light. We define\nthe intensity of electric field at a point as follows:\n\nBring a charge g at the given point without\ndisturbing any other charge that has produced the\nfield.

Such materials are also called\ndielectrics.\n\nIn semiconductors, the behaviour is like an insulator\nat the temperature 0 K. But at higher temperatures, a\nsmall number of electrons are able to free themselves\nand they respond to the applied electric field. As the\nnumber of free electrons in a semiconductor is much\nsmaller than that in a conductor, its behaviour is in\nbetween a conductor and an insulator and hence, the\nname semiconductor. A freed electron in a semiconductor\nleaves a vacancy in its normal bound position. These\nvacancies also help in conduction.\n\nWe shall learn more about conductivity in later\nchapters. At the moment we accept the simple\napproximate model described above. The conductors\nhave large number of free electrons everywhere in the\nmaterial. whereas the insulators have none.

The free electrons there\ndo not experience any net force and the process of\nfurther drifting stops. Thus, a steady state is reached\nin which some positive and negative charges appear\nat the surface of the plate and there is no electric field\ninside the plate.\n\nWhenever a conductor is placed in an electric field\nsome of the free electrons redistribute themselves on\nthe surface of the conductor. The redistribution takes\nplace in such a way that the electric field is zero at\nall the points inside the conductor. The redistribution\ntakes a time which is, in general, less than a\nmillisecond.

I have thoroughly appreciated it, It\nis clear that Dr Verma has spent considerable time in formulating the structure of the book, besides its contents.\nI think he has been successful in this attempt. Dr Verma\u2019s book has been divided into two parts because of the\nsize of the total manuscript. There have been several books on this subject, each one having its own flavour.\nHowever, the present book is a totally different attempt to teach physics, and I am sure it will be extremely\nuseful to the undergraduate students. The exposition of each concept is extremely lucid. In carefully formatted\nchapters, besides problems and short questions, a number of objective questions have also been included. This\nbook can certainly be extremely useful not only as a textbook, but also for preparation of various competitive\nexaminations.\n\nThose who have followed Dr Verma\u2019s scientific work always enjoyed the outstanding contributions he has\nmade in various research areas. He was an outstanding student of Physics Department of IIT Kanpur during\nhis academic career. An extremely methodical, sincere person as a student, he has devoted himself to the task\nof educating young minds and inculcating scientific temper amongst them. The present venture in the form of\nthese two volumes is another attempt in that direction. | am sure that young minds who would like to learn\nphysics in an appropriate manner will find these volumes extremely useful.\n\nI must heartily congratulate Dr Harish Chandra Verma for the magnificent job he has done.\n\nY R Waghmare\nProfessor of Physics\nIIT Kanpur.",

Since then, a large number of teachers, students and physics lovers\nhave made valuable suggestions which I have incorporated in this work. It is not possible for me to acknowledge\nall of them individually. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to them. However, to Dr S B Mathur\nwho took great pains in going through the entire manuscript and made valuable comments, I am specially\nindebted. I am also beholden to my colleagues Dr A Yadav, Dr Deb Mukherjee, Mr M M R Akhtar,\nDr Arjun Prasad, Dr S K Sinha and others who gave me valuable advice and were good enough to find tine\nfor fruitful discussions. To Dr T K Dutta of B E College, Sibpur I am grateful for having taken time to go\nthrough portions of the book and making valuable comments.\n\nI thank my student Mr Shailendra Kumar who helped me in checking the answers. I am grateful to\nDr B C Rai, Mr Sunil Khijwania & Mr Tejaswi Khijwania for helping me in the preparation of rough sketches\nfor the book.\n\nFinally, I thank the members of my family for their support and encouragement.\n\nH C Verma\n\n(viii)\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most",

    "chunk": "\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nTO THE STUDENTS\n\nHere is a brief discussion on the organisation of the book which will help you in using the book most\neffectively. The book contains 47 chapters divided in two volumes. Though I strongly believe in the underlying\nunity of physics, a broad division may be made in the book as follows:\n\nChapters 1-14: Mechanics\n\n15-17: Waves including wave optics\n18-22: Optics\n\n23-28: Heat and thermodynamics\n\n29-40: Electric and magnetic phenomena\n41-47; Modern physics\n\nEach chapter contains a description of the physical principles related to that chapter. It is well supported\nby mathematical derivations of equations, descriptions of laboratory experiments, historical background, etc.\nThere are \"in-text\" solved examples. These examples explain the equation just derived or the concept just\ndiscussed. These will help you in fixing the ideas firmly in your mind. Your teachers may use these in-text\nexamples in the classroom to encourage students to participate in discussions.\n\nAfter the theory section, there is a section on Worked Out Examples. These numerical examples correspond\nto various thinking levels and often use several concepts introduced in that chapter or even in previous chapters.\nYou should read the statement of a problem and try to solve it yourself. In case of difficulty, look at the solution\ngiven in the book. Even if you solve the problem successfully, you should look into the solution to compare it\nwith your method of solution. You might have thought of a better method, but knowing more than one method\nis always beneficial.\n\nThen comes the part which tests your understanding as well as develops it further. Questions for Short\nAnswer generally touch very minute points of your understanding. It is not necessary that you answer these\nquestions in a single sitting. They have great potential to initiate very fruitful dicussions. So, freely discuss\nthese questions with your friends and see if they agree with your answer. Answers to these questions are not\ngiven for the simple reason that the answers could have cut down the span of such discussions and that would\nhave sharply reduced the utility of these questions\n\nThere are two sections on multiple-choice 4\nfour options following each of these questions. (y\n\nnely OBJECTIVE I and OBJECTIVE Il. There are\n\u2018 correct for OBJECTIVE I questions. Any number\n\nof options, zero to four, may be correct for 0!!! \u00bb Answers to all these questions are provided.\n\nFinally, a set of numerical problems are cc, Answers to these problems are also provided.\nThe problems are generally arranged accor|:: \u00a9 of the concepts developed in the chapter but\nthey are not grouped under section-heading: sat Sias your ideas beforehand by telling you that this\nproblem belongs to that section and hence use :e2 jx.: ticular equation. You should yourself look into the problem\n\nand decide which equations or which methods sould he used to solve it, Many of the problems use several\nconcepts developed in different sections of the chapter. Many of them even use the concepts from the previous\nchapters. Hence, you have to plan out the strategy after understanding the problem.\n\nRemember, no problem is difficult. Once you understand the theory, each problem will become easy. So, don\u2019t\njump to exercise problems before you have gone through the theory, the worked-out problems and the objectives.\nOnce you feel confident in theory, do the exercise problems. The exercise problems are so arranged that they\ngradually require more thinking.",

Many of\nthem are rare and of no concern to us in the present\ncourse. The three most common elementary particles\nare electrons, protons and neutrons having masses\nm, = 9110940 x 10\" kg, m, = 167262 x 107\u201d kg and\nm, = 167493 x 10 \u201ckg. Because of their mass these\nparticles attract each other by gravitational forces.\nThus, an electron attracts another electron, placed\n1 cm away, with a gravitational force\n\nF Gm,m,\n\nr\n_ (67x 10\n\n-u 2\n\nNm \u2018kg *)x (91x10 kg)\n(10\u00b0 m)?\n\n-67\n\n=5:5x10 N.\n\nHowever, an electron is found to repel another\nelectron at lem with a force of 23x 10~\u201cN. This\nextra force is called the electric force. The electric force\nis very large as compared to the gravitational force\nThe electrons must have some additional property,\napart from their mass, which is responsible for the\nelectric force. We call this property charge. Just as\nmasses are responsible for the gravitational force,\ncharges are responsible for the electric force. Two\nprotons placed at a distance of 1cm also repel each\nother with a force of 2\u00b03x 10-\u201cN. Thus, protons also\nhave charge. Two neutrons placed at a distance of 1 cm\nattract each other with a force of 1:9x 10~\u201d N which\n\n. G",

G\nis equal to pace Thus, neutrons exert only\n\ngravitational force on each other and experience no\nelectric force. The neutrons have mass but no charge.\nTwo Kinds of Charges\n\n+ As mentioned above, the electric force between two\nelectrons is the same as the electric force between two\n\nprotons placed at the same separation. We may guess\nthat the amount of charge on an electron is the same\nas that on a proton. However, if a proton and an\nelectron are placed 1 cm apart, they attract each other\nwith a force of 23x10 \u201c'N. Certainly this force is\nelectric, but it is attractive and not repulsive. The\ncharge on an electron repels the charge on another\nelectron but attracts the charge on a proton. Thus,\nalthough the charge on an electron and that on a\nproton have the same strength, they are of two\ndifferent nature. Also, if we pack a proton and an\nelectron together in a small volume, the combination\ndoes not attract or repel another electron or proton\nplaced at a distance. The net charge on the\nproton-electron system seems to be zero. It is,\ntherefore, convenient to define one charge as positive\nand the other as negative. We arbitrarily call the\ncharge on a proton as positive and that on an electron\nas negative. This assignment of positive and negative\nsigns to the proton charge and the electron charge is\npurely a convention. It does not mean that the charge\non an electron is \u201cless\u201d than the charge on a proton.\n\nUnit of Charge\n\nThe above discussion suggests that charge is a\nbasic property associated with the elementary particles\nand its definition is as difficult as the definition of\nmass or time or length. We can measure the charge\non a system by comparing it with the charge on a\nstandard body but we do not know what exactly it is\nthat we intend to measure. The SI unit of charge is\ncoulomb abbreviated as C. 1 coulomb is the charge\nflowing through a wire in 1s if the electric current in\nit is 1 A. The charge on a proton is\n\ne= 160218 x 10\u00b0\" C,\nThe charge on an electron is the negative of this value.\n\nCharge is Quantized\n\nIf protons and electrons are the only charge\ncarriers in the universe, all observable charges must\n\n",

If an object contains n,\nprotons and n, electrons, the net charge on the object is\nny(e) + n(- e) = (ny = n,)e.\n\nIndeed, there are elementary particles other than\nprotons and electrons, which carry charge. However,\nthey all carry charges which are integral multiples of\ne. Thus, the charge on any object is always an integral\nmultiple of e and can be changed only in steps of e,\nie. charge is quantized. ,\n\nThe step size e is usually so small that we can\neasily neglect the quantization. If we rub a glass rod\nwith a silk cloth, typically charges of the order of a\nmicrocoulomb appear on the rubbed objects. Now,\n1 uC contains n units of basic charge e where\n\n16x10 \"C\nThe step size is thus very small as compared to\n\nthe charges usually found and in many cases we can\nassume a continuous charge variation.\n\n=6x10\u201d.\n\nCharge is Conserved\n\nThe charge of an isolated system is conserved. It\nis possible to create or destroy charged particles but\nit is not possible to create or destroy net charge. In a\nbeta decay process, a neutron converts itself into a\nproton and a fresh electron is created. The charge\nhowever, remains zero before and after the event.\n\nFrictional Electricity : Induction\n\nThe simplest way to experience electric charges is\nto rub certain solid bodies against each other. Long\nago, around 600 BC, the Greeks knew that when amber\nis rubbed with wool, it acquires the property of\nattracting light objects such as small pieces of paper.\nThis is because amber becomes electrically charged. If\nwe pass a comb through dry hair, the comb becomes\nelectrically charged and can attract small pieces of\npaper. An automobile becomes charged when it travels\nthrough the air. A paper sheet becomes charged when\nit passes through a printing machine. A gramophone\nrecord becomes charged when cleaned with a dry cloth.\n\nThe explanation of appearance of electric charge\non rubbing is simple. All material bodies contain large",

All material bodies contain large\nnumber of electrons and equal number of protons in\ntheir normal state. When rubbed against each other,\nsome electrons from one body may pass on to the other\nbody, The body that receives the extra electrons,\nbecomes negatively charged. The body that donates the\nelectrons, becomes positively charged because it has\nmore protons than electrons. Thus, when a glass rod\nis rubbed with a silk cloth, electrons are transferred\nfrom the glass rod to the silk cloth. The glass rod\n\nbecomes positively charged and the silk cloth becomes\nnegatively charged.\n\nIf we take a positively charged glass rod near small\npieces of paper, the rod attracts the pieces. Why does\nthe rod attract paper pieces which are uncharged ? This\nis because the positively charged rod attracts the\nelectrons of a paper piece towards itself. Some of the\nelectrons accumulate at that edge of the paper piece\nwhich is closer to the rod, At the farther end of the piece\nthere is a deficiency of electrons and hence positive\ncharge appears there. Such a redistribution of charge in\na material, due to the presence of a nearby charged body,\nis called induction. The rod exerts larger attraction on\nthe negative charges of the paper piece as compared to\nthe repulsion on the positive charges. This is because the\nnegative charges are closer to the rod. Hence, there is a\nnet attraction between the rod and the paper piece.\n\n29.2 COULOMB\u2019S LAW\n\nThe experiments of Coulomb and others established\nthat the force exerted by a charged particle on the other\nis given by\n\nrah,\nr\n\nve (29.1)\n\nwhere g, and q, are the charges on the particles, r is the\nseparation between them and k is a constant. The force\nis attractive if the charges are of opposite signs and is\nrepulsive if they are of the same sign. We can write\nCoulomb's law as 5\nRqigo?\n\nre\nwhere 7 is the position vector of the force-experiencing\nparticle with respect to the force-exerting particle.

A particle creates\na gravitational field around it and this field exerts\nforce on another particle placed in it. The electric force\nbetween two charged particles is also seen as a two-\nstep process. A charge produces something called an\nelectric field in the space around it and this electric\nfield exerts a force on any charge (except the source\ncharge itself) placed in it. The electric field has its own\nexistence and is present even if there is no additional\ncharge to experience the force. The field takes finite\ntime to propagate. Thus, if a charge is displaced from\nits position, the field at a distance r will change after\na time t=r/c, where c is the speed of light. We define\nthe intensity of electric field at a point as follows:\n\nBring a charge g at the given point without\ndisturbing any other charge that has produced the\nfield. If the charge g experiences an electric force F,\nwe define the intensity of electric field at the given\n",

It turns out that\nthe materials may be broadly divided into three\ncategories according to their behaviour when they are\nplaced in an electric field.\n\nIn some materials, the outer electrons of each atom\nor molecule are only weakly bound to it. These\nelectrons are almost free to move throughout the body\nof the material and are called free electrons. They are\nalso known as conduction electrons.

Such materials are also called\ndielectrics.\n\nIn semiconductors, the behaviour is like an insulator\nat the temperature 0 K. But at higher temperatures, a\nsmall number of electrons are able to free themselves\nand they respond to the applied electric field. As the\nnumber of free electrons in a semiconductor is much\nsmaller than that in a conductor, its behaviour is in\nbetween a conductor and an insulator and hence, the\nname semiconductor. A freed electron in a semiconductor\nleaves a vacancy in its normal bound position. These\nvacancies also help in conduction.\n\nWe shall learn more about conductivity in later\nchapters. At the moment we accept the simple\napproximate model described above. The conductors\nhave large number of free electrons everywhere in the\nmaterial. whereas the insulators have none. The\ndiscussion of semiconductors is deferred to a separate\nchapter.\n\nRoughly speaking, the metals are conductors and\nthe nonmetals are insulators.

The free electrons there\ndo not experience any net force and the process of\nfurther drifting stops. Thus, a steady state is reached\nin which some positive and negative charges appear\nat the surface of the plate and there is no electric field\ninside the plate.\n\nWhenever a conductor is placed in an electric field\nsome of the free electrons redistribute themselves on\nthe surface of the conductor. The redistribution takes\nplace in such a way that the electric field is zero at\nall the points inside the conductor. The redistribution\ntakes a time which is, in general, less than a\nmillisecond.
